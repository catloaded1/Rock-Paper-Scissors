Read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/clubgamma/code-of-conduct) before starting contributing.

After the successful fork, you'll acknowledge a copy of this repo on your own.
 
  - **Clone the repo**
  
Now it's time to copy this repo to my own laptop/PC. To clone the repo you can write the below command in **Git Bash**

        > git clone <REPO_LINK_FROM_YOUR_ACCOUNT>
    
You can get the repo link from the Download section in the repo copied in your account. If youâ€™re still facing problems check out the image below.

  - **Set up remote repo**

- When you clone your fork, it will automatically set your fork as the "origin" remote. Use git remote -v to show your current remotes. You should see the URL of your fork (which you copied in step 3) next to the word "origin". 
If you don't see the "origin" remote, you can add it using the git command below.

        > git remote add origin <REPO_LINK_FROM_YOUR_ACCOUNT>

- Now you have to set up the upstream. write the following Git command to set up the upstream.
> git remote add upstream  https://github.com/clubgamma/Weather-Forecaster.git
 
- Now pull the latest changes from original repo to your local changes by firing the below command
        > git pull upstream master
  
- **It's Code Time now**
  
First of all, make a folder named as your GitHub username which is compulsory.

- After that start writing code inside that folder only and you know what you have to code. Create anything you want using Python only!!

   - **Now it's time to save the work**

      - Stage the changes you have made by firing the below command
        > git add -A
      - Commit the changes 
        > git commit -m "Description of changes/your work"
      - Push the changes to your forked repo
        > git push origin master
